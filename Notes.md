# **Polymorphism**

## What is it?

Polymorphism is when a function behaves differently under different scenarios. e.g. when as function has a+b, when a and b are numbers it performs an ADD but when they are strings, a and b will be concatenated.

## Types of Polymorphism

- Compile time polymorphism
- Runtime polymorphism

### **Compile Time Polymorphism**

Early (Static) Binding - when a function is called directly during compile time. When the compiler encounters a function call in the program, it replaces it with machine language instructions to go to that function.

Function Overloading - one function can perform many different tasks with different types of arguments. ****************************************See Polymorphism.cpp for example.****************************************

ADD() function is used to perform many tasks - polymorphism.
